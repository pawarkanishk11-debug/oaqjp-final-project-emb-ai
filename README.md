## Emotion Detection using IBM Watson NLP

This Final Project implements an AI-based emotion detection system using IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU). The application analyzes a given text statement and returns emotion scores for anger, disgust, fear, joy, and sadness, along with the dominant emotion.

The system integrates the Watson Emotion Prediction API into a Python-based Flask web application. User input is processed through a backend function (`emotion_detector`) that communicates with the API and formats the results into a structured response.

The web interface allows users to submit text, which is then analyzed and displayed with the corresponding emotional breakdown.
